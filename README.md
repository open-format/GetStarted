# What is Hello world?

This starter is an introduction into a new decentralised world and what we believe to be the starting point for 90% of all future applications. It features a fundamental file structure boilerplate, which comprises of an admin area, authentication, and a tokenised system with XP, Badges, and "Reward Tokens", all integrated into a front-end application built using NextJS and the Open Format SDK.

## Mechanics Overview

To keep this as simple as possible weâ€™re very opinionated with the rules while still retaining as much flexibility as possible to account for most scenarios out of the box.

| Mechanism    | Earn          | Utility                    |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| $RewardToken | From Missions | Governance, Digital assets |
| XP           | From Actions  | Progress/Loyalty           |
| NFT Badge    | From Missions | Trophy, Access             |

### Leaderboard

The leaderboard lists the users in descending order by their XP. This leaderboard can be overall, or dimensioned by a time based frequency such days, weeks, months.

### Profile

The profile shows completed actions, completed missions, and gained XP of the signed-in user.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Before we get started there a few steps we need to take first:

1. Web3 wallet - We recommend [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), although a list of wallets supported by Ethereum can be found [here](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet/#main-content). Weâ€™ve created a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS7VuGZ5VgI&list=PLtnXR6ERygvJ6qT6UYSH8Ve3RAdgYJN26&index=6&t=801s) that explains what web3 wallets are, why you need one, and how to use them.
2. Generate an App ID at [https://apps.openformat.tech/](https://apps.openformat.tech/). As Open Format supports multiple networks, make sure you create an App ID on the same network that you use in your starter. The default network used is Polygon.
3. Youâ€™ll need to have **Node 14.6.0** or a later version installed on your local development machine. We recommend using the latest LTS version available.

### Installation

```bash
# With npx (recommended)
npx create-open-format-app <projectName>

# Global installation with npm

npm install -g create-open-format-app \
create-open-format-app <projectName>

# Global installation with yarn

yarn global add create-open-format-app \
create-open-format-app <projectName>
```

## Setup

### App ID

To interact with the Open Format ecosystem, you will need an App ID, which acts as an API Key. You can generate an App ID in yourÂ [App Dashboard](https://apps.openformat.tech/). Generating an App ID requires deploying an application to the blockchain, which requires a Web3 wallet with sufficient funds to cover the gas fees. Depending on the network, you can obtain funds from a [faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).

### Private Key

Your Ethereum wallet's private key is set in the environment variables during setup to be used in the `/api` endpoint to pay for triggering tokens. It is extremely important to keep your private key secure and avoid exposing it within the application. We do not store or have access to your private key during setup. You can view the code [here](https://github.com/open-format/create-open-format-app/blob/main/helpers/index.ts#L53-L94). If using Metamask, see this [guide](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key) on how to export your private key.

### Next Steps

After creating your project, navigate to the project folder and start the development server:

```bash
cd <projectName>
npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

# or

pnpm run dev
```

If everything is setup correctly, the application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) ðŸŽ‰

## Actions and Missions

### What are actions

An action is simply when a user does something in your app, such as connecting their wallet, posting a comment or sending a message. For each action, they will be sent a certain amount of XP tokens. You can set which actions you want users to receive XP tokens for and the amount of XP tokens they will receive for each action. Once a user completes an action, the token mechanism will handle the processing of the on-chain token exchange via the Open Format SDK. You can view completed actions via the Open Format subgraph.

### Setup

1. Edit the action config in `actions.json`
2. instantiate the token system `const tokenSystem = new tokenSystem(sdk)`
3. Add an action trigger and pass the web3 wallet address of the token receiver and the id of the action set in `actions.json`

```jsx
async function handleConnect() {
  if (address) {
    await tokenSystem.handleCompletedAction(address, "connect");
  }
}
```

### Actions config

```json
[
  {
    "id": "connect",
    "amount": 10,
    "description": "Connect your wallet",
    "address": "0x17ee65c8c6059cd84973b1e5865b71d0ebc5ff4f"
  }
]
```

| Key           | Description                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | Specifies the unique identifier for each action, which is used as a reference in the `handleCompletedAction` function. |
| `amount`      | Specifies the number of XP tokens that should be awarded for completing the action.                                    |
| `description` | Provides a brief description of the action.                                                                            |
| `address`     | Specifies the address of the XP token that's being sent.                                                               |

The `actions.json` file configures which actions should be triggered and how many XP tokens should be sent for each action.

### View completed actions

You can view completed actions on-chain using our subgraph. You can see an example [here](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/open-format/mumbai/graphql?query=%7B%0A++actions%28first%3A+2%2C+where%3A+%7Bapp%3A+%220xfa6439e79bd79d245bded41d1bd16f2166347884%22%7D%29+%7B%0A++++amount%0A++++type_id%0A++++token+%7B%0A++++++id%0A++++%7D%0A++++user+%7B%0A++++++id%0A++++%7D%0A++%7D%0A%7D).

## Missions

### What are missions

Missions are sets of actions that users must complete in order to receive tokens. Once a user has completed all the required actions for a mission, they will receive tokens and/or badges. The requirements for each mission are defined in the `missions.json` file, which specifies the actions that need to be completed and how many times each action needs to be completed. Missions are automatically triggered when a set of required actions have been completed. Completed missions can be viewed via the Open Format subgraph.

### Setup

1. Create your Reward tokens and badges.
2. Edit the missions config in `missions.json`

### Missions config

```json
[
  {
    "id": "connect_and_share_mission",
    "description": "Connect twice times and share once",
    "tokens": [
      {
        "address": "0xc8a0c0aCc1ABbD8cE65Df85533e8CCe0cE37B478",
        "amount": 20
      },
      {
        "address": "0x1a7ea9e50b714667fd8422b07933b0945540413c",
        "uri": "ipfs://"
      }
    ],
    "requirements": [
      { "actionId": "connect", "count": 3 },
      { "actionId": "share", "count": 1 }
    ]
  }
]
```

| tokens       | An array of objects that specify the tokens to be awarded for completing the mission, including the address of the token and the amount to be awarded. the `uri` is the link to the metadata if the token is a badge |
| requirements | An an array of objects that specify the actions that must be taken to complete the mission and the number of times they must be completed. the actionId relates to the actions set in the actions.json               |

### View completed missions

You can view completed mission on-chain using our subgraph. You can see an example [here](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/open-format/mumbai/graphql?query=%7B%0A++missions%28first%3A+2%2C+where%3A+%7Bapp%3A+%220xfa6439e79bd79d245bded41d1bd16f2166347884%22%7D%29+%7B%0A++++amount%0A++++type_id%0A++++token+%7B%0A++++++id%0A++++%7D%0A++++user+%7B%0A++++++id%0A++++%7D%0A++%7D%0A%7D).

## Architecture

![architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7047410/233409803-a4ee7ea4-7517-4900-a1e7-50bee04fc20f.png)

## Web2 Auth Integration Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of signing up for Supabase, creating an organization and project, configuring your project's environment variables, creating and configuring a table, adding row-level security, and testing the login functionality.

### Sign up for Supabase

1. Visit the Supabase website at https://supabase.io.
2. Sign up using your preferred method.
3. After signing up, create an organization and a project within the organization.

### Configure Environment Variables

In your newly created project, navigate to the "API" section. Locate the "URL" and "anon public" key. You will use these values to set up your environment variables. Use the example.env.local file in the template and update your variables with the appropriate values.

### Create and Configure Table

1. In your project's dashboard, navigate to the "Table editor" tab.
2. Click on the "New table" button to create a new table.
3. Define your table schema, including column names, data types, and constraints.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98533777/235881970-aee8fc2c-5be9-433a-ac7b-1448497b1869.png)

4. The table should include the following columns: id, email, private_key, and wallet_address.
5. The id column needs to have a foreign key relation to the authentication user table auth.users.id.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98533777/235881935-6337eb9f-49ce-42c0-887a-d2d3cec3a52e.png)

6. Click "Create" to save your new table.

### Add Row Level Security

1. In your table, click on the "RLS policies" button in the top right.
2. Add 2 policies that enable authenticated users to add a row and select their own data. There should be some templates that will guide you through this.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98533777/235881880-3ac0e0be-9438-4ef7-b0a9-98871c16a308.png)

### Testing & Troubleshooting

 - Ensure that your application is configured to use the Supabase client and the environment variables you defined earlier.
 - Test your application's login functionality, ensuring that users can log in and access data appropriately.

If you encounter issues during this process, try the following steps to identify the problem:

 - Verify that your table is set up correctly, with the appropriate columns, data types, and constraints.
 - Double-check that your .env file contains the correct values.
 - Disable row-level security and test again, check if a user is created in the table. If so, you need to update your policies.
 - You can consult the Supabase documentation (https://supabase.io/docs) for further guidance on specific issues.
